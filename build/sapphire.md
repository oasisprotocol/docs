# Sapphire ParaTime

Source: https://docs.oasis.io/build/sapphire/

Sapphire is our official confidential ParaTime for smart contract development
with [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)] compatibility.

* Confidential state, end-to-end encryption, confidential randomness
* Easy integration with EVM-based dApps, such as DeFi, NFT, Metaverse and
  crypto gaming
* Scalability: increased throughput of transactions
* Low-cost: 99%+ lower fees than Ethereum
* 6 second finality (1 block)
* Cross-chain bridges to enable cross-chain interoperability

### Getting Started

Develop and deploy a dApp on Sapphire:

* follow along with a video walkthrough via [Quickstart][quickstart]
* start with a working dApp [demo][demo]
* explore showcase dApps deployed on Sapphire on the [playground][playground]
