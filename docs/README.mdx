# Getting Started

## Use Oasis

The introductory section contains general overview of the Oasis Network such as
the distinction between the consensus layer and different ParaTimes. It
also covers wallets and other tools for managing your assets across the Oasis
chains and how to use unique Oasis features.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/general/oasis-network/'),
    findSidebarItem('/general/manage-tokens/'),
]} />

## Create dApp

Contains learning material for the smart contract developers. Since the Oasis
platform is best known for confidentiality, the most notable ParaTime is
[Oasis Sapphire], an **EVM-compatible** ParaTime with **built-in contract state
encryption**. The Oasis team also prepared a set of libraries called the
[Oasis Privacy Layer] to **bridge existing dApps running on other chains** to
use the unique Sapphire's confidentiality.

The section also covers other ParaTimes such as the non-confidential
[Oasis Emerald] and Wasm-compatible, confidential [Oasis Cipher].

]} />

## Get Involved

Contains information on official channels to get in touch with the Oasis Network
developers and how to contribute to the network.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/get-involved/'),
    findSidebarItem('https://oasisrose.garden'),
    findSidebarItem('/get-involved/run-node'),
    findSidebarItem('/get-involved/oasis-core'),
]} />

## Run Node

If you want to run your own Oasis node, the following section will provide you
with guides on the current Mainnet and Testnet network parameters and how to
set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps running a ParaTime or
just a simple client node for your server to submit transactions and perform
queries on the network.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/node/'),
    findSidebarItem('/node/mainnet/'),
    findSidebarItem('/node/testnet/'),
    findSidebarItem('/node/run-your-node'),
]} />

## Build ParaTimes

Apart from Emerald, Cipher, Sapphire and the Key manager ParaTimes, developers
can learn how to write, compile, sign and deploy their own ParaTimes on the
Oasis Network.

<DocCard item={findSidebarItem('/paratime/')} />

## Develop Core

Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis
Network or just learn more about the Oasis core, this is the place for you.

<DocCard item={ findSidebarItem('/core/') } />

Development of interoperable Oasis network components are made by consensus.
Similar to the Ethereum's ERC/EIP mechanism, Oasis follows Architectural
Decision Records (ADRs) which are first proposed, voted on and can then be
implemented, if accepted.
