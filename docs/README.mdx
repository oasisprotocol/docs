## Use Oasis

This introductory part contains general overview of the Oasis Network such as
the distinction between the consensus layer and different ParaTimes. It
also covers wallets and other tools for managing your assets across the Oasis
chains and how to use unique Oasis features.

## Build on Oasis

Contains learning material for the smart contract developers. Since the Oasis
platform is best known for confidentiality, the most notable ParaTime is
[Oasis Sapphire], an **EVM-compatible** ParaTime with **built-in contract state
encryption**. The Oasis team also prepared a set of libraries called the
[Oasis Privacy Layer] to **bridge existing dApps running on other chains** to
use the unique Sapphire's confidentiality.

Our [Runtime OFfchain Logic (ROFL)][ROFL] enables you to **build secure applications running
offchain** in a trusted environment (TEE) and that seamlessly communicate with
Oasis Sapphire. This is ideal for trusted oracles, compute-expensive tasks
in AI or as a backend for interactive games.

## Get Involved

Contains information on official channels to get in touch with the Oasis Network
developers and how to contribute to the network.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    findSidebarItem("/get-involved/"),
    findSidebarItem("https://oasisrose.garden"),
    findSidebarItem("/get-involved/run-node"),
    findSidebarItem("/get-involved/oasis-core"),
  ]}
/>

## Run Node

If you want to run your own Oasis node, this part will provide you
with guides on the current Mainnet and Testnet network parameters and how to
set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps running a ParaTime or
just a simple client node for your server to submit transactions and perform
queries on the network.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    findSidebarItem("/node/"),
    findSidebarItem("/node/mainnet/"),
    findSidebarItem("/node/testnet/"),
    findSidebarItem("/node/run-your-node/"),
  ]}
/>

## Build ParaTimes

Apart from the Sapphire, Emerald, Cipher and the Key manager ParaTimes,
you can also write, compile, sign and deploy your own ParaTime on the Oasis
Network. This part describes the knobs you need to use to do so.

## Develop Core

Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis
Network or just learn more about the Oasis consensus layer and other core
components, this is the part for you.

<DocCard item={findSidebarItem("/core/")} />

Additions or changes to the interoperable Oasis network components are always
made with consensus. Similar to the Ethereum's ERC/EIP mechanism Oasis follows
formal Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) which are first proposed, voted on
and finally implemented, if accepted.
