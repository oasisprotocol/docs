# Overview

![Oasis architectural design including ParaTime and consensus layers](../general/images/architecture/technology_scalability.svg)

The [Oasis architecture] is designed to have a simple, robust consensus layer
on top which connects handful of ParaTimes executing smart contracts.
DApp developers may choose among those ParaTimes depending on whether they
require confidentiality and/or EVM-compatibility.

Learn more by exploring the ParaTimes below!

|                      | EVM-compatible                                        | Oasis Wasm                                          |
|---------------------:|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidential**     | <DocCard item={findSidebarItem('/dapp/sapphire/')} /> | <DocCard item={findSidebarItem('/dapp/cipher/')} /> |
| **Non-Confidential** | <DocCard item={findSidebarItem('/dapp/emerald/')} />  |                                                     |

[Oasis architecture]: ../general/oasis-network/README.mdx

In addition to building fully native dApps running on one of the Oasis
ParaTimes, you can also add privacy to your existing dApps running on other,
non-confidential chains, and only use Oasis as a *privacy service*.

The Oasis team prepared a rich cross-chain toolkit called the
[**Oasis Privacy Layer**](opl/README.md). It consists of solidity precompiles
integrating bridges and wrapping the OpenZeppelin ERC2771 contract on top of
Sapphire, demonstrates best practices for writing confidential smart contracts
and working examples for you to explore and extend.
