# Cipher ParaTime

The Cipher ParaTime is a Confidential ParaTime for executing Wasm smart contracts.

As the officially supported ParaTime by the Oasis Protocol Foundation, Cipher
allows for:

* Flexibility — Developer can define which data to store in a public
  and which data in the (more expensive) confidential storage
* Security — Rust language primarily used for writing Wasm smart contracts is
  known for its strict memory management and was developed specifically to
  avoid memory leaks
* Scalability — increased throughput of transactions
* Low-cost — 99%+ lower fees than Ethereum
* Cross-chain bridge to enable cross-chain interoperability (upcoming)

If you're looking for EVM-compatible ParaTimes, check out the
[Emerald](../emerald/README.mdx) and the confidential
[Sapphire](../sapphire/README.mdx) paratimes.

## Smart Contracts Development

The Cipher ParaTime implements the [Oasis Contract SDK] API. To learn how to
write a confidential smart contract in Rust and deploy it on the Oasis Cipher
ParaTime, read the related Oasis Contract SDK chapters:
