### Join the Oasis Ambassador Program

We believe the Oasis Network, with its ability to tokenize not just financial tools and currency, but data itself, has the potential to create a better internet. But this is not a mission we can accomplish alone — it will take a legion of evangelists, influencers, technologists and dreamers — to accomplish our goals. We are looking for talented individuals who are passionate about growing the Oasis Network to build a new responsible data economy that benefits people from all backgrounds and all around the world.

By joining our Oasis Ambassador Program, you will have the opportunity to:

* **Evangelize a responsible data economy**: The Oasis Protocol Foundation is focused on building a better internet — one where users are in control and innovation is not bound by locked data silos. Work with us to evangelize and support this privacy-first vision.
* **Earn Rewards:** Receive grants for doing your part and for completing specific tasks.
* **Be Part of the Extended Team:** Be part of a larger community of privacy enthusiasts and will be a key contributor to the Oasis Foundation.
* **Connect with other Oasis community members**: Discuss network updates with others contributing code on the network and give first-hand feedback to developers working on the network based on what you’re hearing in the field.
* **Gain real-world experience and build a name for yourself:** Build real-world experience in the blockchain field and gain new marketable skills to help you in your career. As an ambassador, we’ll post your picture and bio on our website too!

### Apply for a ROSE Bloom Grant

The ROSE Bloom Grants program is the best way to receive funding for your project on the Oasis Network. Designed to help foster the growth of the Oasis ecosystem, the ROSE Bloom Grants program will help kickstart the development of projects in a range of key focus areas.

Proposals will be eligible to receive anywhere from $5k — $50k USD in ROSE tokens, and will be evaluated on the relevance to the success of the network, the technical design of the project, the overall quality of the team, and more. If you’ve got a great idea for improving the Oasis Network or are inspired to build a new DeFi protocol, dapp, or privacy-first product, we’d love to hear about it!

Submit a proposal [here](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/HtYql2aN) and we’ll review.

## 🏦 ROSE Token Distribution Process

Please note that any tokens you earn or win through community programs, such as the Community Cup program  or the Ambassador Rewards program, are not sent to you immediately. You need to complete the KYC process and submit your ROSE wallet address before the Oasis Foundation can send you any ROSE tokens.

This token distribution process can take several weeks from start to finish. To learn more about each step in the process and how long you can expect to wait before you receive your ROSE tokens, please see the [Token Delivery & KYC Guide](token-delivery-and-kyc.md).

## 📲 Setting Up Your ROSE Wallet

In order to receive your ROSE tokens from the Oasis Foundation for any work you have contributed to the network, you need to set up a ROSE wallet.

The recommended way is to use one of the official [Oasis Wallets](../manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/README.mdx), either the web wallet at [wallet.oasisprotocol.org](https://wallet.oasisprotocol.org) or the browser extension wallet [available in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oasis-wallet/ppdadbejkmjnefldpcdjhnkpbjkikoip).

:::tip

Both Oasis Wallets also support connecting to your Ledger-backed ROSE wallet.

If you need more options, take a look our [3rd Party Custody & Wallets](../manage-tokens/holding-rose-tokens/README.md) guide.

## 💰 Delegate Your ROSE Tokens & Earn Staking Rewards

Did you know you grow your ROSE holdings over time, while also contributing to the security of the Oasis Network? The Oasis Network relies on a process called staking in order to ensure the network is protected against attacks. There are mechanisms built into the Oasis Network that pay out rewards to validator nodes that have staked ROSE tokens to secure the network.

Anyone who has ROSE tokens can delegate their tokens to a validator and start earning a slice of that validator's staking rewards, based on how many ROSE tokens are delegated.

You can use one of the official [Oasis Wallets](../manage-tokens/oasis-wallets/README.mdx) to delegate your ROSE tokens to validators. Additionally, [3rd party custody providers and wallets](../manage-tokens/holding-rose-tokens/README.md) also offer you the option of delegating your ROSE tokens.

You can review the list of active Oasis Network validators via the [Oasis Scan](https://www.oasisscan.com/validators) or [Oasis Monitor](https://oasismonitor.com/validators) block explorers or use the built-in facilities of your wallet. You're welcome to delegate your ROSE tokens to any of the active validators.

As you're deciding which validator to delegate to, keep in mind the following information for each validator:

* Current status of the node
* Uptime percentage of the node
* Number of delegators currently delegating to that validator
* Commission rate (the cut of your rewards that the validator claims in exchange for running the node and providing the staking service to you)

You can learn more about each validator by clicking on their name and going to their validator info page.
