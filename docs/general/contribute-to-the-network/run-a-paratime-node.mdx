# Run a ParaTime Node

The Oasis Network has two main components, the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime
Layer.

1. The **Consensus Layer** is a scalable, high-throughput, secure,
   proof-of-stake consensus run by a decentralized set of validator nodes.
2. The **ParaTime Layer** hosts many parallel runtimes (ParaTimes), each
   representing a replicated compute environment with shared state.

Operating a ParaTime requires the participation of node operators who
contribute nodes to the committee in exchange for rewards.
ParaTimes can be operated by anyone, and have their own reward system,
participation requirements, and structure.

As a node operator you can participate in any number of ParaTimes.
While there are a number of ParaTimes under development, below are a few key
ParaTimes that you can get involved in today.
For operational documentation on running a ParaTime, please see the section on
[running a ParaTime node for node operators].

### Cipher ParaTime

An Oasis Foundation developed ParaTime that will enable WebAssembly-based
confidential smart contracts.

### Overview

* **Leading Developer:** [Oasis Protocol Foundation]
* **Status:** Deployed on Mainnet and Testnet
* **Testnet Launch Date:** June 2021
* **Mainnet Launch Date:** October 2021
* **Discord Channel:** [#cipher-paratime](https://discord.gg/3Hnc99YVGu)
* **Requires SGX**: Yes
* **Parameters:**
  * [Mainnet](../oasis-network/network-parameters.md#cipher-paratime)
  * [Testnet](../foundation/testnet/README.md#cipher-paratime)

### Features

* Fully decentralized with node operators distributed across the world.
* Oasis **ROSE** tokens are the native token used in the ParaTime for gas fees.
* Support for WebAssembly smart contracts.
* Support for confidential compute.

### Mainnet Requirements

For your Cipher ParaTime node to be eligible to be elected into the Cipher
committee on Mainnet, your entity needs to:

- Have a validator in the **validator set**.

### Rewards

* The ParaTime will release tokens on-chain to reward nodes for participation.
* The reward program is 2 years long, and tokens will be released per epoch.
* The reward will be 10\~20 ROSE tokens per entity per epoch, where the Oasis
  Protocol Foundation will make the final decision on the reward size upon th
  Cipher's Mainnet launch.
* Incentivized Testnet with ROSE tokens delegated by the Oasis Protocol
  Foundation to Testnet participants based on performance (rewards can be found
  [here](https://oasis-foundation.medium.com/oasis-cipher-paratime-c9f40ae64946)).

### Emerald ParaTime

An EVM-compatible Oasis Foundation developed ParaTime that enables the use of
EVM smart contracts on the Oasis network.

### Overview

* **Leading Developer:** [Oasis Protocol Foundation], with contributions from
  community developers
* **Status:** Deployed on Mainnet and Testnet
* **Testnet Launch Date:** October 2021
* **Mainnet Launch Date:** November 2021
* **Discord Channel:** [#emerald-paratime](https://discord.gg/buFfkxRMBQ)
* **Requires SGX:** No
* **Parameters:**
  * [Mainnet](../oasis-network/network-parameters.md#emerald-paratime)
  * [Testnet](../foundation/testnet/README.md#emerald-paratime)

### Features

* Fully decentralized with node operators distributed across the world.
* Oasis **ROSE** tokens are the native token used in the ParaTime for gas fees.

### Mainnet Requirements

For your Emerald ParaTime node to be eligible to be elected into the Emerald
committee on Mainnet, your entity needs to:

- Have a validator in the **validator set**.
- Have at least **1,000,000.00 ROSE staked/delegated** to it.
