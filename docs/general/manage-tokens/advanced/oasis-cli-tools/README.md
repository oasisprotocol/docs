# Oasis CLI Tools

This section provides documentation on how to manage your ROSE tokens via Oasis CLI tools.

:::caution

If you are not familiar with the command line, we recommend using one of the available [Oasis Wallets](../../oasis-wallets/).

:::

:::caution

Oasis CLI Tools are only fully supported on x86_64 Linux systems.

Support for x86_64 macOS systems is in development. Currently, macOS binary [releases of Oasis Core Ledger](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core-ledger/releases) include both, the Oasis Core Ledger CLI and the Ledger Signer Plugin, while  there are no binary releases of [Oasis Node CLI](../../../run-a-node/prerequisites/oasis-node) for macOS systems. To use Oasis Node CLI on macOS, you will need to [build it from source](../../../run-a-node/prerequisites/oasis-node#building-from-source).
