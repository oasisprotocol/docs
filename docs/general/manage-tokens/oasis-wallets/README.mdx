# Oasis Wallets

## **What are the official Oasis Wallets?**

The [Oasis Foundation](https://oasisprotocol.org) supports two first-party non-custodial wallets, a [web wallet](https://wallet.oasisprotocol.org) named [Oasis Wallet -Web](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-wallet-web/) and a browser extension wallet named Oasis Wallet - Browser Extension. Both seamlessly connect to the [Oasis Network](../../oasis-network/overview.md) and makes it easy to hold, send, and receive ROSE tokens.

These products are fully open source, built from the ground up by Oasis community developers, with funding from the Oasis Foundation’s [ROSE Bloom Grants Program](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/community/discussions/13). Both have also gone through multiple internal audits from the Oasis Foundation and [Oasis Labs](https://oasislabs.com) teams and are currently going through an external audit as well.

## Where to find the official Oasis Wallets?

The [Oasis Wallet - Web](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-wallet-web/) can be found at [wallet.oasisprotocol.org](https://wallet.oasisprotocol.org).
