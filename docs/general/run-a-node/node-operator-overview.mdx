# Overview

[Oasis Network](../oasis-network/overview.md) consists of the Consensus Layer and ParaTimes. Consensus and ParaTime nodes can be operated by anyone.

Consensus Layer is a decentralised set of 120 validator nodes that maintain a proof-of-stake blockchain. The current validator set size is determined by governance - the network started with 80 nodes in the validator set in 2020 and has expanded to 120 over the past few network upgrades. The nodes are operated by independent node operators.

Operating a ParaTime Node on Mainnet requires the participation of node operators who have the validator node in the active validator set. ParaTimes have their own reward system, participation requirements and structure. As a node operator you can participate in any number of ParaTimes.

Current node operators can be seen on a block explorer such as [Oasis Scan](https://www.oasisscan.com/validators). 

## Joining the Network 
The following documentation is intended to assist any individual or organisation in participating in the network as a node operator. To join the network we recommend first running nodes on the Testnet. The Testnet is a playground, where you can try anything without the risk of loosing real ROSEs. 

If you have any questions about running a node you can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RwNTK8t).
