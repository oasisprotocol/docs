# Overview

[Oasis Network] consists of the Consensus Layer and ParaTimes. Consensus and 
ParaTime nodes can be operated by anyone.

Consensus Layer is a decentralised set of 120 validator nodes that are a 
backbone of the Oasis Network. The current validator set size is determined by 
governance - the network started with 80 nodes in the validator set in 2020 and 
has expanded to 120 nodes over the past few network upgrades. The nodes are 
operated by independent node operators. 

Operating a ParaTime Node on the Mainnet requires the participation of node 
operators who have the validator node in the active validator set. ParaTimes 
have their own reward system, participation requirements and structure. As a 
node operator you can participate in any number of ParaTimes.

Current node operators can be seen on a block explorer such as [Oasis Scan].

## Joining the Network 
The following documentation is intended to assist any individual or 
organisation in participating in the Oasis network as a node operator. To join 
the network we recommend you first try running nodes on the Testnet. The 
Testnet is a playground, where you can learn and try anything without the risk 
of loosing real tokens. 

If you have any questions about running a node you can find us on [Discord].
