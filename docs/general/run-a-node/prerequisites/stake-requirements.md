# Stake Requirements

## Mainnet

To become a validator on the Oasis Network, you will need to have enough 
tokens staked in your escrow account.  

Currently, you are going to need:

* 100 ROSE staked for your entity's registration since that is the 
[staking thresholds].
* 100 ROSE staked for your validator node's registration since that is the 
[staking thresholds].
* If you want to be part of the active validator set, you will need enough 
ROSE staked --  this means you will have to be one of the top 120 entities 
by stake. You can check out current top 120 entities on the blockchain explorer 
such as [Oasis Scan].

For more information about obtaining information on your entity's account, see 
the [Account Get Info] doc.

Staking thresholds may change in the future. Read [Common staking info] chapter,
to learn how to check the current network thresholds directly from the 
`oasis-node`.

To determine if you are eligible to receive a delegation from the Oasis Protocol 
Foundation, see the [Delegation Policy] document.

The size of the consensus committee (i.e. the validator set) is configured by 
the [**max_validators** consensus parameter].

## Testnet

For the Testnet you are going to need TEST tokens. You can receive a limited 
number of TEST by using our [Oasis Network Testnet Faucet][faucet-testnet]. For 
more tokens please contact us at our official [Discord #testnet channel]
[discord-testnet].
