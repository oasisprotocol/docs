# ParaTime Node

This guide provides an overview of the requirements to become a compute node for
a ParaTime connected to the Oasis Network.

## About Oasis Network

The Oasis Network has two main components, the consensus layer and the ParaTime
Layer.

1. The **consensus layer** is a scalable, high-throughput, secure,
   proof-of-stake consensus run by a decentralized set of validator nodes.
2. The **ParaTime layer** hosts many parallel runtimes (ParaTimes), each
   representing a replicated compute environment with shared state.

![Oasis architectural design including ParaTime and consensus layers](../../general/images/architecture/technology_scalability.svg)

## Operating ParaTimes

Operating a ParaTime requires the participation of node operators who
contribute nodes to the committee in exchange for rewards.
ParaTimes can be operated by anyone, and have their own reward system,
participation requirements, and structure.

As a node operator you can participate in any number of ParaTimes.
While there are a number of ParaTimes under development, below are a few key
ParaTimes that you can get involved in today.
For operational documentation on running a ParaTime, please see the section on
[running a ParaTime node for node operators].
