# Oasis CLI Tools

This section provides documentation on how to manage your ROSE tokens via Oasis CLI tools.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are not familiar with the command line, we recommend using one of the available [Oasis Wallets](../../oasis-wallets/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Oasis CLI Tools are only fully supported on x86\_64 Linux systems.

Support for x86\_64 macOS systems is in development. Currently, macOS binary [releases of Oasis Core Ledger](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core-ledger/releases) include both, the Oasis Core Ledger CLI and the Ledger Signer Plugin, while  there are no binary releases of [Oasis Node CLI](../../../run-a-node/prerequisites/oasis-node.md) for macOS systems. To use Oasis Node CLI on macOS, you will need to [build it from source](../../../run-a-node/prerequisites/oasis-node.md#building-from-source).
