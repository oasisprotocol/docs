# Run Node

Welcome! This documentation is designed to provide you with a comprehensive
understanding and step-by-step guidance for becoming a node operator within the
Oasis Network.

Embark on your journey by setting up a node on the Testnet. The Testnet serves
as an experimental sandbox, offering a safe environment for learning and 
experimentation, free from the risks associated with real token loss.

For any queries or support related to node operation, our team and community
members are readily available on [Discord] to assist you.

## Validator and ParaTime nodes

[Oasis Network] consists of the consensus layer and ParaTimes. Consensus and
ParaTime nodes can be operated by anyone.

To run a **validator node**, make sure your system meets the [hardware] and the
[system] prerequisites and has [Oasis Node] installed.

Then proceed by following the [Run a Validator Node] guide to:

* Create your entity.
* Initialize and configure your node.
* Put enough stake in your escrow account.
* Register your entity on the network.

To run a **ParaTime node** make sure to first set up a validator node. Then,
set up a [trusted execution environment (TEE)], if you want to run confidential
ParaTimes. Afterwards, proceed to the [Run a ParaTime node] chapter.

:::info

Consensus layer is a decentralised set of 120 validator nodes that are a
backbone of the Oasis Network. The current validator set size is determined by
governance - the network started with 80 nodes in the validator set in 2020 and
has expanded to 120 nodes over the past few network upgrades. Current node
operators can be seen on a block explorer such as [Oasis Scan].

:::

:::info

Operating a ParaTime Node on the Mainnet requires the participation of node
operators who have the validator node in the active validator set. ParaTimes
have their own reward system, participation requirements and structure. As a
node operator you can participate in any number of ParaTimes.

## DApp Developers

If you are **building a service** on top of the Oasis Network, you will simply
want to set up your own **[Non-validator node]** and (optionally) a
**[ParaTime client node]**. This way, your service will not depend on third
party endpoints which can be behind a traffic limiter, can go down unexpectedly,
or they can have some more CPU-intensive queries disabled which you would like
to use.
