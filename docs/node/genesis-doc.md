# Genesis Document

A genesis document contains a set of parameters that outline the initial state
of an Oasis network.

The state defined in the network's genesis document contains all the necessary
information for launching that particular network (i.e. Mainnet,
[Testnet](testnet/README.md)), including initial token allocations, network
parameters, and more.

:::info

For a more in-depth explanation of the genesis document, see the
[Genesis Document](../core/consensus/genesis.md) part of Oasis Core's developer
documentation.

:::

The important thing to note is that the genesis document is used to compute the
[genesis document's hash](../core/consensus/genesis.md#genesis-documents-hash).
This hash is used to verify for which network a given transaction is intended
for.

## Genesis File vs. Genesis Document

A genesis file is a JSON file corresponding to a serialized genesis document. As
such, it is more convenient for distribution and sharing.

When Oasis Node loads a genesis file, it converts it to a genesis document.

:::info

Up to date information about the current genesis file and the current genesis
document's hash can be found on the [Network Parameters](mainnet/README.md)
page.

:::

## Parameters

This sections explains some of the key parameters of the genesis document.

:::caution

The concrete parameter values in the following sections pertain to the Mainnet.
Other Oasis networks (e.g. [Testnet](testnet/README.md)) might use different
values.

:::

:::danger

The token balances in a genesis document (or a genesis file) are enumerated in
base units.

The **`staking.token_value_exponent`** parameter defines the token value's
base-10 exponent. For the Mainnet it is set to 9 which means 1 ROSE equals 10^9
(i.e. billion) base units.

:::

### Height, Genesis Time and Chain ID

The **`height`** parameter specifies the network's initial block height. When a
network is upgraded, its height is retained. For example, for the
[Cobalt upgrade](mainnet/previous-upgrades/cobalt-upgrade.md) the height of the
Mainnet state dump was bumped by 1 from 3,027,600 to 3,027,601.

The **`genesis_time`** parameter is an ISO8601 UTC timestamp that specifies when
the network is officially going to launch. At the time of genesis, validators
are expected to come online and start participating in the consensus process for
operating the network. The network starts once validators representing more than
2/3 of stake in the initial consensus committee are online.

The **`chain_id`** is a human-readable version identifier for a network.

:::caution

It is important to note that this value alone doesn't dictate the version of an
Oasis network. Rather, the hash of the whole genesis document, i.e. the
[genesis document's hash](../core/consensus/genesis.md#genesis-documents-hash),
is the network's unique identifier.

:::

### Registry

Within the **`registry`** object, there are a broad range of parameters that
specify the initial set of node operators and their corresponding initial node
statuses.

* **`registry.params.max_node_expiration`** The maximum duration (in epochs)
  that node registrations last. The starting value is set to 2 in order to
  ensure that a node is continuously online, since the node’s registration would
  expire each time 2 epochs pass, requiring the node to re-register.

* **`registry.params.enable_runtime_governance_models`** The set of
  [runtime governance models] that are allowed to be used when creating/updating
  registrations. It is set to `{"entity": true, "runtime": true}` which means a
  runtime can choose between **entity governance** and **runtime-defined
  governance**.

* **`registry.entities`** The entity registrations for initial node operators,
  including public key and signature information.

* **`registry.runtimes`** The initial runtime registrations. Each item describes
  a runtime's operational parameters, including its identifier, kind, admission
  policy, committee scheduling, storage, governance model, etc. For a full
  description of the runtime descriptor see the [`Runtime` structure]
  documentation.

* **`registry.suspended_runtimes`** The initial suspended runtime registrations.
  Each item describes a suspended runtime's operational parameters, including
  its identifier, kind, admission policy, committee scheduling, storage,
  governance model, etc. For a full description of the runtime descriptor see
  the [`Runtime` structure] documentation.

* **`registry.nodes`** The node registrations for initial node operators,
  including public key and signature information.

:::info

For a new network, the entity and node registrations are obtained via the entity
package collection process (e.g. [Mainnet Network Entities]).

For an upgrade to an existing network, the network's state dump tool captures
the network's current entity and node registrations.

  ParaTime transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.runtime_epoch_maintenance`** The cost of a
  maintenance fee that a node that is registered for a ParaTime pays each epoch.
  The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.unfreeze_node`** The cost for unfreeze node (i.e.
  after the node is slashed and frozen) transaction. The current value is 1000.
* **`keymanager.params.gas_costs.publish_ephemeral_secret`** The cost for

:::caution

In addition to the gas costs specified above, each transaction also incurs a
cost proportional to its size.

The **`consensus.params.gas_costs.tx_byte`** parameter specifies the additional
gas cost for each byte of a transaction. The value is set to 1.

For example, a staking transfer transaction of size 230 bytes would have a total
gas cost of 1000 + 230.

:::

### Root Hash

:::info

**Interpreting your account balance in the `staking.ledger`**

Your account's **`general.balance`** includes all of your tokens that have not
been staked or delegated. Within your account's `escrow` field, the
`active.balance` holds the total amount of tokens are (actively) delegated _to_
you.

:::

#### Delegations

The following parameters control how delegations behave on the network:

#### Node & ParaTime Token Thresholds {#staking-thresholds}

There are several **`staking.params.thresholds`** parameters that specify the
minimum number of tokens that need to be staked in order for a particular entity
or a particular type of node to participate in the network.

The **`entity`,** **`node-compute`, `node-keymanager`, and **`node-validator`**
parameters are set to 100,000,000,000 base units for each, indicating that you
need to stake at least 100 ROSE tokens in order to have your entity or any of
the specified nodes go live on the network.

thresholds for registering new ParaTimes. The **`runtime-compute`** and
**`runtime-keymanager`** parameters are set to 50,000,000,000,000 base units,
indicating that you need to stake at least 50,000 ROSE tokens in order to
register a compute/key manager ParaTime.

#### Rewards

The following parameters control the staking rewards on the network:

* **`staking.params.reward_schedule`** The staking reward schedule, indicating
  how the staking reward rate changes over time, defined at an epoch-by-epoch
  granular basis. The reward schedule uses a tapering formula with higher
  rewards being paid out at earlier epochs and then gradually decreasing over
  time. For more details, see the [Staking Incentives] doc.
* **`staking.params.signing_reward_threshold_numerator`** and
  **`staking.params.signing_reward_threshold_denominator`** These parameters
  define the proportion of blocks that a validator must sign during each epoch
  to receive staking rewards. The set fraction of 3/4 means that a validator
  must maintain an uptime of at least 75% blocks during an epoch in order to
  receive staking rewards for that period.

  transaction fees. The value is set to 1.
* **`staking.params.reward_factor_epoch_signed`** The factor for rewards
  distributed to validators who signed at least threshold blocks in a given
  epoch. The value is set to 1.
* **`staking.params.reward_factor_block_proposed`** The factor for rewards
  earned for block proposal. The value is set to 0, indicating validators get no
  extra staking rewards for proposing a block.

  is “frozen,” or barred from participating in the network's consensus
  committee. The value of 18446744073709551615 (the maximum value for a 64-bit
  unsigned integer) means that any node slashed for equivocation is, in effect,
  permanently banned from the network.

* **`staking.params.slashing.consensus-light-client-attack.amount`** The amount
  of tokens to slash for light client attack. The value is set to
  100,000,000,000 base units, or 100 ROSE tokens.
