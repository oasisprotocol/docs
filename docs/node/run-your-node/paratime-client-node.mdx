# ParaTime Client Node

This guide will cover setting up your ParaTime client node for the Oasis
Network. This guide assumes some basic knowledge on the use of command line
tools.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have fulfilled all the requirements outlined in the
[Prerequisites] chapter before proceeding with node configuration.

[Prerequisites]: ./paratime-node.mdx#prerequisites

## Configuration

For the Emerald ParaTime, configuring paths to ParaTime bundles is required.
However, for the Sapphire and Cipher ParaTimes, this setup is optional, as
bundles are automatically downloaded from the [Oasis Bundle Registry].

In order to configure the ParaTime client node, create the `/node/etc/config.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
mode: client
common:
    data_dir: /node/data
    log:
        format: JSON
        level:
            cometbft: info
            cometbft/context: error
            default: info
genesis:
    file: /node/etc/genesis.json
p2p:
    seeds:
      # List of seed nodes to connect to.
      # NOTE: You can add additional seed nodes to this list if you want.
        - {{ seed_node_address }}
runtime:
    # Paths to bundles for ParaTimes without hot-loading support (e.g., Emerald).
    paths:
        - {{ runtime_orc_path }}
    # Runtime configuration for every ParaTime. Mandatory for ParaTimes with
    # hot-loading support (e.g. Sapphire, Cipher).
    runtimes:
        - id: {{ runtime_identifier }}
        # List additional ParaTimes here.
    # The following section is required if at least one ParaTime is running
    # inside the Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment.
    sgx_loader: /node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader
```

Before using the configuration, replace the following variables:

* `{{ seed_node_address }}`: The seed node address in the form `ID@IP:port`.
  * You can find the current Oasis Seed Node address in the Network Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).
* `{{ runtime_orc_path }}`: Path to the [ParaTime bundle](./paratime-node.mdx#manual-bundle-installation) of the form
`/node/runtimes/foo-paratime.orc`. See the [Advanced](#advanced) section for more information.
  * You can find the current Oasis-supported ParaTimes in the Network Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).
* `{{ runtime_identifier }}`: You can find the runtime identifier in the Network
Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).

:::caution

Make sure the `consensus` port (default: `26656`) and `p2p.port` (default: `9200`) are exposed and publicly
accessible on the internet (for `TCP` and `UDP` traffic).

### Steteless Client Node (optional)

Client node requires sufficient disk space and must wait for synchronization.
A stateless client node fetches state via configured gRPC endpoints (provider node addresses) and uses a light client
to verify data against state roots from block headers. It can be started using the following configuration:

```yaml
mode: client-stateless
# ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
consensus:
    providers:
        - <node-address-1>
        - <node-address-2>
        # Add more node addresses as needed
```

To ensure compatibility, all provider nodes specified must be running the latest version of Oasis Core.

### TEE ParaTime Client Node (optional)

If your node requires the ability to issue queries that can access confidential
data, start by following the [Configuration](#configuration) section to create
the `/node/etc/config.yml` file. Once the file is set up, add the following
content to the `runtime` part within the `/node/etc/config.yml` file:

```yaml
# ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
runtime:
    # Paths to bundles for ParaTimes without hot-loading support (e.g., Emerald).
    paths:
        - {{ runtime_orc_path }}
    # Configuration for all ParaTimes with hot-loading support
    # (e.g., Sapphire, Cipher)
    runtimes:
        - id: {{ runtime_identifier }}
        # List additional ParaTimes here.
    # The following section is required for ParaTimes which are running inside
    # the Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment.
    sgx_loader: /node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader
```

Before using the configuration, replace the following variables:

* `{{ runtime_orc_path }}`: Path to the [ParaTime bundle](paratime-node.mdx#manual-bundle-installation) of the form
`/node/runtimes/foo-paratime.orc`.
  * You can find the current Oasis-supported ParaTimes in the Network Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).
* `{{ runtime_identifier }}`: You can find the runtime identifier in the Network
Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).

### Enabling Expensive Queries (optional)

In case you need to issue runtime queries that may require more resources to
compute (e.g. when running a Web3 Gateway), you need to configure the following
in your node's `/node/etc/config.yml` file:

```yaml
# ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
runtime:
    # Paths to ParaTime bundles for all of the supported ParaTimes.
    paths:
        - {{ runtime_orc_path }}
    # Configuration for all ParaTimes with hot-loading support
    # (e.g., Sapphire, Cipher)
    runtimes:
        - id: {{ runtime_identifier }}
            components: {}
            # ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
            config:
                {{ runtime_id }}:
                    estimate_gas_by_simulating_contracts: true
                    allowed_queries:
                        - all_expensive: true 
```

Before using the configuration, replace the following variables:

* `{{ runtime_orc_path }}`: Path to the [ParaTime bundle](paratime-node.mdx#manual-bundle-installation) of the form
`/node/runtimes/foo-paratime.orc`.
  * You can find the current Oasis-supported ParaTimes in the Network Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).
* `{{ runtime_id}}`: You can find the `runtime_id` in the Network Parameters
chapter ([Mainnet], [Testnet])
* `{{ runtime_identifier }}`: You can find the runtime identifier in the Network
Parameters page ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).

## Starting the Oasis Node

You can start the node by running the following command:

```bash
oasis-node --config /node/etc/config.yml
```

## Checking Node Status

To ensure that your node is properly connected with the network, you can run the following command after the node has started:

```bash
oasis-node control status -a unix:/node/data/internal.sock
```
