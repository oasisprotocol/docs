# ROFL Node

:::info

These instructions are for setting up a _ROFL node_ which executes ROFLs inside
a TEE, but otherwise only observes the ParaTime activity and can also submit
transactions.

:::

This guide will cover setting up your ROFL node for running ROFL apps on the
Oasis Network. This guide assumes some basic knowledge on the use of command
line tools.

## Prerequisites

### ParaTime Client Node

ROFL node is a special kind of a **ParaTime Client Node** with a TEE-capable
hardware in order to securely run ROFLs. First, complete the ParaTime Client
Node instructions:

1. Set up your [ParaTime Client Node] including support for [TEE ParaTimes].
2. Add the Sapphire ParaTime to your node ([Mainnet], [Testnet]).
3. To support [ROFL TDX apps][rofl-types] enable support for the
   [Intel TDX] on your node.

[ParaTime Client Node]: ./paratime-client-node.mdx#configuration
[TEE ParaTimes]: ./paratime-client-node.mdx#tee-paratime-client-node-optional
[Mainnet]: ../network/mainnet.md#sapphire
[Testnet]: ../network/testnet.md#sapphire
[Intel TDX]: ./prerequisites/set-up-tee.mdx#tdx
[rofl-types]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/blob/main/docs/rofl/workflow/init.md
[client-stateless]: ./paratime-client-node.mdx#stateless-client-node-optional

:::tip

Consider running ROFL node in [client-stateless] mode for faster bootstrapping and using less resources.

:::

### Configure Firewall

Since you will be hosting 3rd party applications on your server, we strongly
recommend to **configure your firewall to prevent any local area network
connections from ROFL apps**.

Using `iptables`, running something like this will prevent Oasis node and other
processes owned by the `oasis` user accessing LAN on `192.168.0.255` except for
the gateway:

```
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.1/32 -m owner --uid-owner $(id -u oasis) -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.0/16 -m owner --uid-owner $(id -u oasis) -j DROP
```

You can also permanently store the rules above. On Debian-based OSes you can do
so by running:

```shell
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo /etc/init.d/iptables-persistent save
```

### Fund Your Node

The node will also need to cover any transaction fees required to maintain
registration of the ROFL node and the apps. First, determine the address of the
account corresponding to your node:

```shell
oasis-node identity show-address -a unix:/node/data/internal.sock
```

```
oasis1qp6tl30ljsrrqnw2awxxu2mtxk0qxyy2nymtsy90
```

Then fund this account **on Sapphire** by transferring or depositing
tokens with the [`oasis account`] command, for example:

```shell
oasis account transfer 10 oasis1qp6tl30ljsrrqnw2awxxu2mtxk0qxyy2nymtsy90
```

If you are just testing out your node on Sapphire Testnet, you can also request
some TEST from the [Testnet Faucet].

[`oasis account`]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/cli/blob/master/docs/account.md
[Testnet Faucet]: https://faucet.testnet.oasis.io/?paratime=sapphire


## Configuration

There are two ways you can host ROFL apps on your ROFL node. The preferred way
is to join a network of ROFL providers called the **ROFL marketplace** and which
is also integrated in the [`oasis rofl deploy`] command. Alternatively, you can
copy ROFL bundle(s) directly to your node and configure each one of them in your
node configuration file.

[`oasis rofl deploy`]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/cli/blob/master/docs/rofl.md#deploy

### Hosting via ROFL marketplace

To make your ROFL node accessible through [ROFL marketplace], you will:

1. Create a new [ROFL provider entity](#register-rofl-provider).
2. [Configure one or more ROFL nodes](#configure-rofl-node-marketplace) to
   execute ROFL transactions corresponding to that provider and/or machine.

Both steps take place solely on-chain. There is no centralized mechanism or KYC
process involved at any time.

[ROFL marketplace]: https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/blob/main/docs/rofl/features/marketplace.mdx

#### Register your ROFL provider {#register-rofl-provider}

To register a new ROFL provider, using the [Oasis CLI] to run the following
command:

```shell
oasis rofl provider init
```

Then edit your `rofl-provider.yaml` and add one or more hosting offers. Now
obtain your [Node ID] and decide how much resources you are willing to lend out.
In the example below, we'll offer *small* instances with 4 GiB of memory, 2 CPUs
and 20 GB of storage. Hourly rent will cost 10 tokens and there can be at most
50 active instances at a time.

[Node ID]: ./validator-node.mdx#obtain-the-node-id

```yaml title="rofl-provider.yaml"
network: testnet
paratime: sapphire
provider: test:erin
nodes:
  - 5MsgQwijUlpH9+0Hbyors5jwmx7tTmKMA4c9leV3prI=
scheduler_app: rofl1qrqw99h0f7az3hwt2cl7yeew3wtz0fxunu7luyfg
payment_address: test:erin
offers:
  - id: small
    resources:
      tee: tdx
      memory: 4096
      cpus: 2
      storage: 20000
    payment:
      native:
        terms:
          hourly: 10
    capacity: 50
```

To register a new provider using the configuration above, run:

```shell
oasis rofl provider create
```

The account signing the transaction is now registered as a ROFL provider
on-chain. In our case, the built-in `test:erin` account which we used for
signing has address `oasis1qqcd0qyda6gtwdrfcqawv3s8cr2kupzw9v967au6`.

:::info

Registering a new ROFL provider requires depositing
[100 tokens][stake-requirements] which are returned to you, when you deregister
it.

#### Configure your ROFL node for the marketplace {#configure-rofl-node-marketplace}

1. Download the [latest release of the Scheduler ROFL app][rofl-scheduler]
   and save it to your ROFL node, for example `/node/rofls/`. This app will
   listen to ROFL hosting requests, configure any incoming ROFLs and spin them
   up. It will also listen to ROFL admin request for stopping or restarting the
   ROFL machines.
2. Add the Scheduler ROFL app to your Oasis node's `config.yml` inside the
   `runtime.paths` and configure the scheduler specifics such as the provider
   address, acceptable offers and capacities on this node:

    ```yaml title="config.yml"
    runtime:
      sgx:
        loader: /node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader
      paths:
        - /node/rofls/rofl-scheduler.testnet.orc
      runtimes:
        # Sapphire Testnet RONL with SGX
        - id: "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a6d1e3ebf60dff6c"
          config:
            allowed_queries:
              - all_expensive: true
          components:
           - id: rofl.rofl1qrqw99h0f7az3hwt2cl7yeew3wtz0fxunu7luyfg # ROFL scheduler app ID, should not change
             permissions:
               - bundle_add
               - bundle_remove
               - volume_add
               - volume_remove
             config:
               rofl_scheduler:
                 provider_address: oasis1qqcd0qyda6gtwdrfcqawv3s8cr2kupzw9v967au6 # Your provider address
                 offers:
                   - small # Your offer name(s)
                 capacity:
                   instances: 24
                   memory: 65536
                   cpus: 24
                   storage: 549755813888
    ```
3. Restart your Oasis node. After a while, your ROFL node will be ready to
   accept ROFLs. ROFL app developers can now simply deploy their ROFL to your
   node by providing the `--provider <your address>` to the [`oasis rofl deploy`]
   command.

   ```shell
   oasis rofl deploy --provider oasis1qqcd0qyda6gtwdrfcqawv3s8cr2kupzw9v967au6
   ```

:::tip Multiple ROFL nodes

If you configured multiple ROFL nodes for a single provider, the machine
instantiated to execute the ROFL app will be arbitrarily picked depending on
which ROFL node register transaction appears first on chain.

:::

#### {#rofl-app-id-remap}

:::tip Multiple ROFL replicas on a single node

The ROFL scheduler supports running multiple replicas of the same ROFL app on
the same ROFL node by **remapping** the ROFL app ID to a unique value on each
deployment. Look for the `starting processor` message in [your
logs](#checking-status) to figure out the remapped value, for example:

```json
{
  "app_id":"rofl1qrjtky678pd3uchsdlhqtjugnsvtck3wyg7w5324",
  "component":"rofl.4bd2d31255ae7e5cec31084cde02fb40640d4d678db111d1c6ba53478f5f2fc2",
  "msg":"starting processor",
  ...
}
```

Above, the original ROFL app ID `rofl1qrjtky678pd3uchsdlhqtjugnsvtck3wyg7w5324`
was remapped to `4bd2d31255ae7e5cec31084cde02fb40640d4d678db111d1c6ba53478f5f2fc2`.

### Hosting the ROFL App Bundle Directly

To execute a ROFL app on your node, simply copy it over to your node, for
example inside the `/node/rofls` folder. Then, put the location of the ORC
bundle to the `runtime.paths` section of your configuration similarly to
how other ParaTimes can be enabled on your node:

```yaml title="config.yml"
runtime:
  # ... other options omitted ...
  paths:
    - /node/rofls/myapp.default.orc
```

Check that the path to your ROFL app bundle is correct. After starting your
node, please make sure that the node is fully synchronized with Sapphire.

### Exposing the ports

To expose a specific TCP port of a ROFL app externally, add the following
configuration to your Oasis node config:

```yaml title="config.yml"
runtime:
  runtimes:
    - id: "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a6d1e3ebf60dff6c"
      components:
        - id: rofl.rofl1qpkplp3uq5yage4kunt0ylmulett0arzwcdjvc8u # Your ROFL app ID
          networking:
            incoming:
              - ip: 192.168.0.10
                protocol: tcp
                src_port: 443
                dst_port: 443
```

In the example above, we exposed a TCP port `443` externally on the IP address
`192.168.0.10` of our host.

## Persistent storage

The encrypted persistent storage of each ROFL app replica lives in
`/node/data/runtimes/volumes/{random hex value}` folder.

It is generated when a ROFL app is executed for the first time and will remain
intact even during ROFL upgrades and removal. Beside is also a `descriptor.json`
that contains information which ROFL app does this volume belong to and other
metadata.

## Checking status

You can check the logs of any ROFL app by grepping its app ID in your Oasis node
log file. Since a Scheduler app to manage your ROFLs is also just a ROFL app,
you can check if there are any issues reported by Scheduler by grepping for
the its app ID:

```shell
grep rofl.rofl1qrqw99h0f7az3hwt2cl7yeew3wtz0fxunu7luyfg /node/data/node.log
```

To extract only the relevant `msg` field you may do:

```shell
grep rofl.rofl1qrqw99h0f7az3hwt2cl7yeew3wtz0fxunu7luyfg /node/data/node.log | jq -r '.msg'
```

When exploring the logs, keep in mind that the ROFL app IDs of the
Scheduler-managed apps [will be remapped](#rofl-app-id-remap).
