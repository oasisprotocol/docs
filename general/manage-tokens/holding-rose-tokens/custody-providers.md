# Custody Providers & Protocols

Source: https://docs.oasis.io/general/manage-tokens/holding-rose-tokens/custody-providers

Another way to hold your ROSE is by involving custodial partners—either
by giving them complete custody over your tokens
([Custody Providers](#custody-providers)) or just require a multi-signature
transaction to move them and then splitting some of those keys among trusted
parties ([Decentralized Custody Protocols](#decentralized-custody-protocols)).
We've partnered with industry-leaders who support a number of top crypto
assets. You can pick among the custodial providers or decentralized custody
protocols below.
