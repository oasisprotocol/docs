# Token Delivery & KYC Guide

Source: https://docs.oasis.io/get-involved/token-delivery-and-kyc

If you're visiting this page, you may have recently earned ROSE tokens via the Community Cup program, the Ambassador Rewards program, or a recent hackathon. Congratulations!

Let's review the process for receiving your ROSE tokens from the Oasis Foundation:

* **Step 1: Wait to be contacted regarding KYC by an Oasis Foundation core team member.** We will reach out to you via email to the email address we have on file for you for Oasis-related activities. This email will contain information about how to complete the KYC process. Please allow our team approximately 1 to 3 weeks after the day you have won or earned your ROSE tokens before reaching out to us with any questions. If 3 weeks have passed since the day you won or earned your ROSE tokens, you are welcome to reach out to us via our [token delivery question form](https://airtable.com/shrGmpohTNnytBpQU).

**Caution**:

Please be sure to use the same email address for all Oasis-related activities. For example, if you registered for the Oasis Ambassador Rewards program with a specific email address, use that same email address when you complete the KYC process and when you contact the Oasis team if you have any questions.

**Info**:

For the Ambassador Rewards program, reward submissions will be tallied up after each quarter (every 3 months) and will require an additional 3 weeks to update the leaderboard and apply any bonuses. Rewards will be sent out on the third Friday following the end of a given quarter. If you have rewards outstanding past any given quarterly distribution date, we will be doing weekly distributions on Fridays, but only if you have completed all of the steps described in his document.

* **Step 2: Complete the KYC process.** The KYC email you receive will contain everything you need to complete the KYC process which lets us know that you are eligible to receive ROSE tokens. In particular, you first need to request access to Synaps, which is the online KYC tool the Oasis Foundation uses. Once you get access to Synaps, you need to get verified in all 3 of the required categories. How long this step takes depends on how long you take to submit all of the required documentation, following all of the required guidelines. Assuming you submit all of the necessary documents correctly right away, you can expect this step to take around 1 week. When your documents and information have been verified, we'll reach out again via email with next steps

**Info**:

The  Proof of Residency document required for Synaps must be dated within 3 months of the date you are submitting it, and the document must include your name and your address, matching the information you have submitted to Oasis.

* **Step 3: Submit the address of your Oasis account.** After you complete the KYC process, you will receive a follow-up email from the Oasis Foundation with information on how to submit your Oasis account address via a unique code that connects your wallet to your KYC data. Please allow at least 1 full week to pass after you complete KYC to receive the follow-up email with instructions on how to submit your account address.
* **Step 4: Receive the tokens deposited to your Oasis account.** After you have completed KYC and submitted your Oasis account address, allow 1 to 2 weeks for your ROSE to be deposited into your wallet. We will be doing weekly token distributions on Fridays, but only if you have completed all of the steps described in his document.

**Caution**:

Before reaching out to our team with questions, please make sure you have closely reviewed each of the steps described in this document and that you have correctly completed each step.    Please consider only reaching out for support via our [token delivery question form](https://airtable.com/shrGmpohTNnytBpQU) if you have correctly followed all of the instructions but for some reason have not received any communications from our team. Thank you for your cooperation in helping us manage our resources so that we can more effectively support the community.
