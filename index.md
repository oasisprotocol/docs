# Getting Started

Use Oasis to build verifiable, auditable applications
powered by TEE running on a permissionless network of nodes. No censorship,
no hidden costs, no central authority!

Get your hands dirty quickly by reviewing [top use cases](https://docs.oasis.io/build/use-cases.md)
and considering one that fits your needs. Our tutorials will help you make
your app up and running in no time.

Our [Runtime Offchain Logic (ROFL)](https://docs.oasis.io/build/rofl.md) enables you to build
secure applications running in a trusted environment (TEE). This is ideal
for trusted oracles, AI agents, verifiable compute tasks such as AI
training, or game servers.

ROFL can seamlessly communicate with [Oasis Sapphire](https://docs.oasis.io/build/sapphire.md)—an
EVM-compatible L1 blockchain with built-in contract state and end-to-end
transaction encryption.

The Oasis team also prepared a set of libraries called the
[Oasis Privacy Layer](https://docs.oasis.io/build/opl.md) to bridge existing dApps running
on other chains with the unique Sapphire's confidentiality and other
[tools](https://docs.oasis.io/build/tools.md).

Learn the fundamentals of Oasis architecture, wallets, and unique privacy
features.

Connect with developers, run infrastructure, and contribute to the future of Oasis.

If you want to run your own Oasis node, this part will provide you with guides on the current Mainnet and Testnet network parameters and how to set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps running a ParaTime or just a simple client node for your server to submit transactions and perform queries on the network.

Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis Network or just learn more about the Oasis consensus layer and other core components, this is the part for you.

Additions or changes to the interoperable Oasis network components are always made with consensus. Similar to the Ethereum's ERC/EIP mechanism Oasis follows formal Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) which are first proposed, voted on and finally implemented, if accepted.
