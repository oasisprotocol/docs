- [Architectural Decision Records: ADR 0003: Consensus/Runtime Token Transfer](https://docs.oasis.io/adrs/0003-consensus-runtime-token-transfer.md): Currently each runtime can define its own token (or none at all) and there is no mechanism that would support transfer of consensus layer tokens into a runtime and back out.
- [Architectural Decision Records: ADR 0004: Runtime Governance](https://docs.oasis.io/adrs/0004-runtime-governance.md): Currently all runtimes can only be governed by a single entity -- the runtime owner.
- [Architectural Decision Records: ADR 0005: Runtime Compute Node Slashing](https://docs.oasis.io/adrs/0005-runtime-compute-slashing.md): The runtime compute nodes make updates to the runtime state by submitting commitment messages to the roothash service in the consensus layer where discrepancy detection and resolution are performed.
- [Architectural Decision Records: ADR 0006: Consensus Governance](https://docs.oasis.io/adrs/0006-consensus-governance.md): Currently the consensus layer does not contain any on-chain governance mechanism so any network upgrades need to be carefully coordinated off-chain.
- [Architectural Decision Records: ADR 0007: Improved Random Beacon](https://docs.oasis.io/adrs/0007-improved-random-beacon.md): The existing random beacon used by Oasis Core, is largely a placeholder implementation that naively uses the previous block's commit hash as the entropy input.
